        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a senior at UW-Madison double majoring in Data and Information Science originally from Elm Grove, WI. My
          family is from Syria. I am interested in data, technology, and understanding how systems shape social
          outcomes. My academic work focuses on technology, ethics, data, and digital systems. My personal interests
          include video games, aviation, American football and basketball, and movies/shows. </p>

        <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
        <p>Academically, I am interested in machine learning, mathematics, and managing data, and the main reason I took
          this course is because I am especially interested in how technology can both reinforce and challenge
          inequality. Studying implicit bias and intersectionality helps explain how systems affect different
          communities in different ways.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a senior at UW-Madison. From a young age I have always been interested in technology. Especially
          computers. I had access to my first computer at around 10 years old and found it fascinating how capable they
          were. I started college later than most of my peers as I spend 5 years in the Marine Corps. But I always knew
          I wanted to go to the UW. My other interests include video games, spending time with friends, hiking,
          swimming, boating and really anything outdoors. As long as it isn't too cold!</p>

        <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
        <p>I am Majoring in Computer Science and love learning about technology. I am also interested in learning about
          inequality in every industry and how we can combat it, but especially the tech industry. <a

          is a link to a paper I wrote about sexism in Computer Science a few years ago. I look forward to expanding my
          knowledge about discrimination in the sector including that related to intersectionality</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and Information Science, originally from Eden Prairie, Minnesota.
          My academic journey has been shaped by a strong interest in data-driven systems, software development, and
          emerging technologies. I am particularly drawn to fields such as Data Science, Software Engineering, and
          Artificial Intelligence </p>

        <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
        <p>My academic interests center on understanding how governments and corporations design and implement
          safeguards to protect data. I am especially focused on issues related to data privacy, security, and ethical
          use. As technology becomes more integrated into everyday life, I want to explore how institutions can ensure
          that data is handled responsibly and not misused or exploited. </p>
