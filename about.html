        <h1>John</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a senior at UW-Madison. From a young age I have always been interested in technology. Especially computers. I had access to my first computer at around 10 years old and found it fascinating how capable they were. I started college later than most of my peers as I spend 5 years in the Marine Corps. But I always knew I wanted to go to the UW. My other interests include video games, spending time with friends, hiking, swimming, boating and really anything outdoors. As long as it isn't too cold!</p>

        <p>I am Majoring in Computer Science and love learning about technology. I am also interested in learning about inequality in every industry and how we can combat it, but especially the tech industry. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19bHjj19v5HGZCXoq1m_k1S3RGj47XKES4JNNRdGT3nI/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> is a link to a paper I wrote about sexism in Computer Science a few years ago. I look forward to expanding my knowledge about discrimination in the sector including that related to intersectionality</p>
