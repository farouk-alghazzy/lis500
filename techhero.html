      <!-- Bio section -->
      <p>
        Joy Buolamwini is a researcher and advocate for algorithmic accountability and AI ethics. She is the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization that investigates and raises awareness about bias in AI systems.</p>
      <p>
        Her work focuses on ensuring that artificial intelligence is developed and deployed in ways that are fair, transparent, and inclusive. She wrote the best-selling book Unmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What is Human in a World of Machines. Her work is extremely important in this new field that is rapidly evolving and shaping our future and if not handled correctly could further disenfranchise minorities especially those of intersecting identities. Her work has already uncovered large racial and gender bias in AI services from major companies such as Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon.</p>
