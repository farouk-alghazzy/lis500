    <h1>Implicit Bias & Intersectionality</h1>
  </header>

<section>
  <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
  <p>
    Implicit bias refers to unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that influence our decisions and behaviors. These biases operate automatically and are shaped by cultural messages, media representation, and historical inequalities.
  </p>

  <p>
    In our course readings, racism is described not just as individual prejudice but as a system embedded in institutions and power structures. Robin DiAngelo argues that focusing only on individual “good” or “bad” people hides the larger structures that reproduce inequality. This helps explain why bias can persist even when individuals believe they are acting fairly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Implicit bias matters because it influences real-world outcomes. Hiring decisions, classroom expectations, healthcare treatment, and even algorithm design can reflect patterns of inequality that exist in the broader culture.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>What is Intersectionality?</h2>
  <p>
    Intersectionality is a framework developed by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw to explain how systems of power overlap. Instead of treating race, gender, or class as separate categories, intersectionality examines how these identities interact simultaneously.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, the experiences of a Black woman cannot be understood only through race or only through gender. These identities intersect and shape unique forms of discrimination and opportunity. Intersectionality focuses on structural systems rather than ranking individuals by “victim status,” which is a common misunderstanding of the theory.
  </p>

  <p>
    This framework is especially important in conversations about technology and inequality. It shows why focusing on only one dimension of diversity can leave other forms of exclusion unaddressed.
  </p>

  <h2>Technology, Power, and Inequality</h2>
  <p>
    Our readings on technology emphasize that technological systems are not neutral. Judy Wajcman argues that gender and technology shape each other. The people involved in designing and managing technologies influence how those systems function and whom they benefit.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reading on Indigenous labor in early semiconductor manufacturing challenges the common narrative that Silicon Valley was built only by white male engineers. Navajo women played a key role in chip production, yet their contributions are rarely highlighted in mainstream histories. This shows how race, labor, and technology are deeply connected.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, critiques of “colorless diversity” in tech argue that focusing primarily on white women while ignoring racial inequality fails to address intersectional power structures. These discussions reinforce why both implicit bias and intersectionality are necessary tools for analyzing inequality in technological spaces.
